Thanks for your patience. We discussed it with Engineering and as a
result we are sending you additional header files needed to complete a
successful compile for libgstcamsrc. Thank you for bringing this to
our attention.

The attached files are:
* camd_msg.h
* profile.h
* simple_ipc.h
* PalmOmxjpegEncExif.h

We hope this resolves the issue.
All the best.
